# Daily EngBridge 

**Daily EngBridge** is a Chrome extension designed to help learners "bridge" the gap in their English vocabulary. It delivers a word of the day based on the user's proficiency level (B1, B2, or C1), complete with definitions and usage examples.



## Features

- **Level-Based Learning:** Choose between Intermediate (B1), Upper-Intermediate (B2), and Advanced (C1).
- **Scheduled Notifications:** Set your preferred time to receive your daily dose of English.
- **System Integration:** Uses native desktop notifications to keep you engaged even when the browser is minimized.

## Installation

Since this extension is in development, you can install it as an "unpacked" extension:

1. **Download** or **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on the **Load unpacked** button.
5. Select the folder containing the extension files.

## How it works

1. **Setup:** Click the extension icon and select your English level and the time you want to be notified.
2. **The Alarm:** The script sets a daily alarm based on your settings.
3. **The Notification:** At the set time, a random word matching your level is shown via a system notification.
